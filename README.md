# Tree-based-paper
This repository contains codes for the first arxiv version of the paper **On marginal feature attributions of tree-based models**.
There are three folders:

  1) **TreeSHAP_sanity_check**: This is to confirm the computations done in Example 3.1 regrading the path-dependent TreeSHAP.
  2) **models_metrics**: Two triples of model files are provided each for a public dataset. Each triple contains a LightGBM, an XGBoost and a CatBoost model trained for the same task and data. The Juoyter notebook in the folder is to verify the explained variance scores for these models as appeared in Table 4 of the paper. 
  3)
